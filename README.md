The data matching R code matches schools with the microfinance institution providing the best terms and conditions and the supplier providing the product fitting their needs the most.
1) The code identifies whether any supplier operates in the region where the school is, whether it needs more funding than the maximum amount of loan any MFIs provide, whether it needs less funding than the minimum amount of loan any MFIs provide.
2) The code runs through the data base to calculate the minimum total cost of the solution and the minimum interest.
